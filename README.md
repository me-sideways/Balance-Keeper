This update introduces substance logging, marking the first step towards creating a more comprehensive substance use tracker. Future updates will expand on this by incorporating half-life tracking and visualizing how substances are metabolized over time.

Planned features include tracking substance half-lives, onset of action, and warnings for increasing usage patterns. These enhancements aim to help users gain better insight and control over their substance use.
